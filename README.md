## **Step-by-step Running:**

## 1. Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NJAU-CDSIC/CircaLLM.git
cd CircaLLM
```

## 2. Environment Installation

It is recommended to use the conda environment (python 3.11), mainly installing the following dependencies:

```bash
conda env create -n circallm python==3.11
conda activate circallm
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

See requirements.txt for details.

## 3. Datasets and model parameters

To ensure repository stability and comply with platform size limitations, critical components of CircaLLM are hosted externally on figshare. **Full functionality requires downloading these resources separately**:
